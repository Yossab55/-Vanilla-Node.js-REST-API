# Vanilla Node.js REST API

Welcome to my Vanilla Node.js REST API project! This is a simple yet powerful RESTful API built from scratch using Node.js, following the Traversy Media tutorial. The project demonstrates core concepts like routing, HTTP methods, and basic CRUD operations without relying on heavy frameworks.

## Project Overview

This API allows you to perform basic operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources. It’s lightweight, easy to understand, and perfect for learning the fundamentals of backend development with Node.js.

### Features

- Built with pure Node.js (no Express or other frameworks)
- UUID for unique resource identification
- Nodemon for live server reloading during development
- Simple and clean codebase

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
  git clone <your-repo-link>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
  cd <project-folder>
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
  npm install
```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following packages:

- nodemon - For auto-restarting the server during development
- uuid - For generating unique IDs

## Running the Project

To start the development server with live reloading:

```
  npm run dev
```

## Scripts

The `package.json` includes the following script:

```json
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
```

Runs the server with Nodemon for auto-reloading.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or curl.  
The API supports standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for managing resources.
